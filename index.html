    <h2>Radio</h2>
    <p>There is real date of when the radio started but early scientists who saw and investigated the effects on electricity and magnetism were crucial. Galvani, Hery, and Edison saw elctromagnetic waves during his experiment. Maxwell was the the fist to electromagnetic wave by proving it mathemtically, and published his finding in a number of paper. In 1887 Heinrich Hertz proved the physical existence of radio waves. He made an transmitter madde of a spark gap across and induction coil with a loop of a wire to act as an antenna. The reciver consisted of a smaller gap in a loop as the transmitter. During his experiment, he found many of the waves property.In 1894, The coherer, an item used to detect radio waves took many years to develop with the earliest observations dating back to 1850. It was invented by a  Frenchmen named Edouard Branly. Branly found out that the resistance of a glass tube filled with metal filings fell a few hundred ohms when an electrical discharge occurred nearby. In 1894, Marconi perfofmed his first experiments with radio waves in his parent's attic. First, he only able to achieve distances only a few meters, than increasing and then reached 2 kilometers. In 1925 the Westinghouse Company set up a short wave broadcasting station (KDKA) in East Pittsburgh which transmitted on a wavelength of 62.7 meters. It was rebrodcast in Britain. In Britain the amateur station 2NM run by Gerald Marcuse started in 1927. These 2 station gained great popularity and shortly after their start the BBC commenced broadcast from an experimental station. In 1957  the USSR launched the first satellite into orbit. The satellite was in a very low orbit and took 96 minute to circle the earth.</p>

    <h2>Apple Mac</h2>
    <p>Electronic Numerical Intergrator and Computer(ENIAC) by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. The university described it as the "first general-purpose electronic computer." IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981. While IBM's PC was not the first- others was avalible since the 1970s but this PC was incredably popular. The PC costed $1,565, the IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user self-diagnostic checks. Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. With Vangelis' "Chariots of Fire" playing in the background, the Apple cp-founder showcased a number of the number of the Macintosh's capabilities, from its ability to "talk" to a drawing application. Steve had grand ambition for the product saying "Macintosh is targeted at two primary markets. The first is the 2.5 million 'knowledge workers' who sit behind desks, and particulary those in medium and small-sized businesses. And the second market is the college worker, we think that's the knowledge worker of towmorrow and there are over 11 million colloge students in America alone" In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for a "distrinuted information system" at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Today's home are rapidly transforming into spaces where traditional computers dovetail alongside newer pieces of technology, from smartphones being played on a computer in someone's bedroom can be beamed to and desplayed on a 72-inched TV in their livingroom via high speed, wireless connection </p>

    <h2>Earbuds</h2>
    <p>The current headphones is alot different from the headphones in the 1890s and was called the Electrophone and was invente theater subscribers could listen in to on any given night, while 15 different churches could be dile on Sundays The Electrophone Company was founded in 1894 and had 50 subscribers by 1896. The subscribers grew to 1000 in 1919, but reached its high watermark in 1923 with over 2000 subscribers. The Electrophone Company has lost thounsand subscribers in 1924 and ran out of business in 1925. On the other sides of the Alantic, Nathaniel Baldwin was tinkering with coiled copper wiring in his kitchen in 1910. Baldwin had been hoping to find ways to amplified the sounds of sermons at his local Mormon temple. He created a device that could recive sound without electricity, He showed his idea with private investors, but they scoffed at the idea at the time, but when he showed the U.S Navy, they bought dozens of the devices. <i>SSense</i> said "The military's deplyment of these headphones, which sailors used to isolate sounds boadcast form distant locations, lent them a more intense, solitary aesthetic than the hand-held Electrophone headset." Several companies worked on similar devices for the next forty years, and including the German firm Bayerdynamic, who produced the first dynamic consumer headphones in 1937. The first  stereo headphones was invented by John Koss in 1958, In 1979, the Sony Walkman was invented and it was the Sony's portable music experience that took the world by storm. In 2008, Jimmy Lovine and Andre Yound, partnered to put out a new lined of headphones called "Beats by Dr.Dre," Designed to bring the bass-heavy sound. </p>

    <p>In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci was the first person to sketch a fuse for a clock. In 1504-1508, Peter Henlein invents what was consider the first pocket watch, which makes him the first inventor of the poket watch. In the 1500s </p>
